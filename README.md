# Blog Manager

## Description

**Blog Manager** is a simple front-end web application that allows users to view, interact with, and create blog posts. It fetches data from a local mock API (`json-server`) and dynamically displays blog titles. Users can click on a post to view its details and also submit new posts through a form.

## Learning Goals

- Understand DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Practice working with `fetch()` and RESTful APIs
- Build interactive UIs with event listeners
- Use `json-server` to simulate backend functionality
- Organize JavaScript code using a `main()` function pattern

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- JSON Server (`json-server`)

### Prerequisites

To run this project, make sure you have:

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- `json-server` installed globally or locally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g json-server
